# Review
See below sections for overview of how it went overall


**Interesting Finds**
* Lack of RESTFUL endpoints eg. GetEnginesById
* entryTime value on the workstations endpoint produced uncertainity


**Decisions Made**
* Create app using Vite + Vue 3 Composition API
* Due to a lacking GetEnginesById API endpoint I had to store the data locally then query this data when I needed a certain engine. 
* Use of Fetch vs Axios for data retrieval
* use of constants module for API endpoints (cleaner)
* Decided to use Bootstrap CSS as this contains utilities that simply styling & responsiveness
* Decided to go for CSS rather than SCSS
* Incomplete Tasks: styling not complete, missing logic to handle entryTime value

**Summary**
* I'll be able to give a more detailed account during the call later.
